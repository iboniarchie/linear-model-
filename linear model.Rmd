# Introduction


Read about the data from the website where it is staged Then form three    
regression models; Model1 is SIMS~ARM, Model2 is SIMS~Grip and Model3 is     SIMS~ARM+GRIP for each model find a 95% prediction interval OF SIMS given a    
value of 94 for GRIP and 88 for the ARM Compare Model1 with Model3 using     anova.Write it up in a markdown document, push the project up to you github     
account and submit it back to canvas as link.    

# SIMS~ARM






This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```




```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.






###Basic scatterplot

```{r}
plot(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
```

The y -axis is SIMS and the X- axis is ARM. This plot is showing a positive  
linea correaltion   




```{r}
basicNN <- ggplot(data,aes(y=SIMS,x=ARM))
```
### Basic Scatterplot  


```{r}
basicNN + geom_point()
```
  
  
    
```{r}
basicNN + geom_point(aes(SIMS=ARM)) 
```



### Numerical Descriptive Results     

```{r}
cor(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
```

The value of the correlation is a positive 0.68. The indicates that the line  
will traveling up hill and towards the right.  


### Inferential  (Build linear model)    
  
```{r}
model.1 <- lm(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
summary.lm(model.1)
```

The evaluation for the line that fits this is SIMS is equal to -4.1+.05 * ARM  
The Formula needed is y = mx + b to create a line. The adjusted R-squared is  
the line it looks at.  


### Linear model wilth blue line      
  
```{r}
basicNN + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm)
``` 

It appears that where the line crosses on the X axis is at 100 and meets on the  
on the y axis at 1  

  
```{r}
newdata = data.frame(GRIP = 94, ARM = 88)
predict(model.1, newdata, interval = "prediction")
```
   

# SIMS~GRIP  

  

Plot scatterplot  

```{r}
plot(SIMS~GRIP,data=data)
```

  

```{r}
basicNN <- ggplot(data,aes(y=SIMS,x=GRIP))
```

### Basic Scatterplot    

```{r}
basicNN + geom_point()
```


 


```{r}
basicNN + geom_point(aes(SIMS=GRIP)) 
```




### Numerical results

```{r}
cor(SIMS~GRIP,data=data)
```



### Inferential  (Build linear model)    
  
```{r}
model.2 <- lm(SIMS~GRIP,data=data)
summary.lm(model.2)
```


### Linear model with blue line   
  
```{r}
basicNN + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm)
``` 



```{r}
predict(model.2, newdata, interval = "prediction")
```











# SIMS~ARM + GRIP


### Inferential  (Build linear model) Results


```{r}
model.3 <- lm(SIMS~ARM + GRIP,data=data)
summary.lm(model.3)
```

GRIP * .024470 + ARM * 0.37311= SIMS
The bigger the adjusted R squared the better the model. The bigger the
multiple adjusted squared the more you reduce the error


```{r}
predict(model.3, newdata, interval = "prediction")
```
