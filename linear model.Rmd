## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

###Plot scatterplot

```{r}
plot(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
```

The y -axis is SIMS and the X- axis is ARM. This plot is showing a positive  
linea correaltion   

```{r}
basicNN <- ggplot(data,aes(y=SIMS,x=ARM))
```











```{r}
basicNN + geom_point()
```
  
  
###get fancy  


```{r}
basicNN + geom_point(aes(SIMS=ARM)) 
```




##Now with ggplot - first select the basic data

```{r}
basicNN <- ggplot(data,aes(y=SIMS,x=ARM))
```


```{r}
basicNN + geom_point()
```





# Numerical results

```{r}
cor(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
```

The value of the correlation is a positive 0.68. The indicates that the line  
will traveling up hill and towards the right.  


# Inferential  (Build linear model)
  
```{r}
model.1 <- lm(SIMS~ARM,data=
                data)
summary.lm(model.1)
```

The evaluation for the line that fits this is SIMS is equal to -4.1+.05 * ARM  
The Formula needed is y = mx + b to create a line. The adjusted R-squared is  
the line it looks at.  


# now add the model fit to our plot
  
```{r}
basicNN + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm)
``` 

It appears that where the line crosses on the X axis is at 100 and meets on the  
on the y axis at 1  



```{r}
newdata = data.frame(GRIP = 94, ARM = 88)
predict(model.1, newdata, interval = "prediction")
```


###Plot scatterplot

```{r}
plot(SIMS~GRIP,data=data)
```

##Now with ggplot - first select the basic data

```{r}
basicNN <- ggplot(data,aes(y=SIMSt,x=GRIP))
```
```{r}
basicNN <- ggplot(data,aes(y=SIMS,x=GRIP))
```


```{r}
basicNN + geom_point()
```
